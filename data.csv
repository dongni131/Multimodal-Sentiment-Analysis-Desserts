https://www.yelp.com/biz/sidney-dairy-barn-sidney,5,8/7/2021,A delicious treat on a hot day! Staff was very friendly and helpful-- gave us a sample and let us order a little earlier than open.,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ThWSPoGOUkjaljDMq7drMA/348s.jpg,A few words about the dessert.
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,4/20/2022,"Pro-tip: Definitely give the rotating ice cream flavors a try - they offer samples! The double scoop is worth the money if you're sharing with someone. Highlights: The female workers the night we went were super nice and so honest with their opinions about the ice cream flavors. They let us sample a few of them and then gave us the biggest double scoop! For sure worth $6. The ice cream itself was insanely good, very creamy, rich, and actually better than a ton of ice cream shops in the area. Lowlights: Some of the ice cream flavors on the menu weren't actually available which was a little disappointing.","https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BF8iMGocsJHDmOZC0dZtkQ/348s.jpg, https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HoIpxeKJ6aZXlMPhrjPDyw/348s.jpg",i've written a review of the best ice cream in new york city i love the look of this cake!
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,3,7/18/2022,"After seeing some positive reviews about Rewind, I wanted to stop by and check it out for myself. A store that sells boba and ice cream at the same time? Say less and hook me up because I'm coming over at the speed of light. Now onto the review: Dessert/Drink (3/5): For the drink, I got a Blueberry Matcha Latte and I got the Matcha Madness (in a cone) for dessert. Let's start with the drink. As someone who absolutely loves matcha, I knew I had to order this. It is different from most matcha drinks I typically see in which this one comes with blueberry puree. The drink was a good size for what the price was; however, the drink isn't that spectacular. The matcha flavor was nice but the blueberry didn't really add any wow factor to the drink. If anything, I felt as if I couldn't ever taste the blueberry so that was rather disappointing. The Matcha Madness ice cream included the following toppings: two pocky sticks and chocolate shavings. I find that the ice cream itself was pretty smooth and had a really good matcha flavor to it. Only downside was that it was really melty within a minute and the ice cream wasn't as pretty/have a nice swirling effect. Atmosphere (5/5): The establishment was really pretty and I absolutely love the vibe. Decor was pretty minimal but any place that has a neon sign and a grass wall is amazing in my eyes haha. The store was also very clean and neat. Seating was pretty limited as there was only 4 - 5 tables. Service (4/5): Service was alright. I didn't find it to special or felt that workers went out of their way. Did notice that a worker was talking to their buddies when people were waiting to order. Overall, just lack of attention to customers; however, the drink and ice cream came out at a good pace. Overall, Rewind offers customers a good mixture of drinks and ice cream selection to satisfy any sweet cravings. The attention to customer could be improved but timing between order and handout was good. Would I come back? If I was in the area then maybe, but I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to go. Might only get ice cream if I go though as the drink was average.","https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xTKZJyVGvUwJWWAI4zmP7A/348s.jpg, https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/egXVzrnX-drgWkJJxKTZeA/348s.jpg","ice cream with chocolate and caramel sauce ice cream with caramel sauce a chocolate shake with strawberry syrup s topped with chocolate caramel sauce a st It's a fun challenge to see if you can describe the words, ""drink it like itâs hot"" in your picture"

Convenient that they have boba drinks, ice cream, shakes, etc - something to please everybody! The girls opted for a Taro Milk Tea and the Butterfly Strawberry Lemonade - both with boba. I chose the Chocolate Crumble Ice Cream cone. Everybody was happy with their choices & enjoyed the late night refreshment.

https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,9/3/2021,"Rewind has a trendy look, but the beauty isn't just skin deep. This is my go to boba place when I'm in Chandler. Layered drinks like the rose milk latte aren't just eye-catching on Instagram-- they're also delicious! I've tried their milk tea and their fruity tea, and they do both well. I would definitely bring anyone here, because they serve things like ice cream and can please people who don't like/aren't willing to try boba. It's also a little cheaper than some other boba places around here. Every time I've been here, the staff have been exceptionally nice. That, coupled with how quickly they make drinks, is what really makes them a five star establishment in my eyes. They also have a good variety of flavors, including non dairy and caffeine free choices, and the ability to customize sugar levels. Someday I'll get ice cream here, but their tea is so good that I haven't been able to not order it!",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/T2fvQw1EaG_zpfwiAZVk7Q/348s.jpg,a picture of a dessert with a cup of coffee in a bowl of coffee

I feel like even when the tea taste good, if boba is hard and undercooked, I tend to feel that drink isn't good, and I guess that was the case. Although, I came here for ice cream one time, and their ice cream was pretty flavorful, they have some of the very unique flavors, I think I had Vietnamese coffee flavored ice cream and it was pretty good! Probably I'll come back here for the ice cream but not for boba!",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0NFuXUFmSABqFLM1BAXntQ/348s.jpg,a man with a shaved head is eating a hamburger and fries

I tried a vanilla swirl with Reese's peanut butter cups mixed in - kind of like a Blizzard at DQ, with banana slices on top. The ice cream was quite sweet.

They have both soft serve and hard scoop artisanal varieties. I ordered the Matcha Madness soft serve which came with chocolate shavings and picky sticks. I found the matcha flavor to be bland unfortunately. The hard scoop ice creams are not available in matcha flavor. On to the drinks, I ordered the strawberry matcha latte at the recommended 75% sweetness. The matcha flavoring was quite prominent, I was very happy with my choice. I would like to try the Matcha Americano next. I also had the Butterfly Strawberry Lemonade. Its colors were so beautiful I hesitated to mix it up but alas, must move forward. This drink is pretty unique in that none of the flavors are distinctive. If someone handed me the drink I would not have guessed it contained strawberries or lemons. It was a little too sweet for me at 75%, I would order 50% next time.",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/x_1Dtk9C4IhO3B7l_T-Spg/348s.jpg,"a jiju-sa jiju-sa is a dessert in japan that has a lot of flavors and different kinds of desserts, ranging from fruit and cakes, pastries, ice creams, sweets and sweets, but also snacks and desserts"

The Jasmine milk tea at 50% sugar was perfect for my husband and I, whereas the matcha coffee at 50% sugar was too sweet.

https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,3,2/20/2021,"Rewind, what in the world happened?? This used to be my absolutely favorite place for ice cream because of the authenticity of the matcha. What happened to your quality of matcha ice cream?? This is absolutely unacceptable. I can't remember the girl's name but she was one that helped established the place and she knew how to make matcha. She remembers me and regardless of what I order, she always has it down to the T. Her drinks were right, her ice cream, everything. Every passing time that I have come by here from late 2020, I haven't seen her. And every one of those time, the matcha ice cream quality has been..well.. sh*t. Hopefully the photos are in order but you can see from the course of 2 years how the quality has gone down each time. It was great at first then it dwindled to crap. Time by time the ice cream becomes more and more powdery rather than blended. This last time I had actual powder at the bottom of the cone and broken all over my pants. How is this matcha ice cream? And the color of the ice cream was extremely distorted. White and green all over. And there are actual chunks of unblended matcha power that are suspiciously oxidate like it's old matcha. You can tell by the color and the taste. This is so disappointing. I have scout out every boba and matcha place in the Phoenix and surrounding area. Please don't ruin your reputation by your newer employees not knowing how to make matcha ice cream. I won't be coming back. I'm sorry, too many disappointed times.","https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/PC2mN_LgWL1NI9CLXw5ehQ/348s.jpg, https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/1u8hLSvz-lsv2V52fivkMA/348s.jpg","a hot chocolate, with chocolate and caramel sauce u00f9;douu00f9; i lu00f9; u00f0; u00f9; u00f9; u00f0; u00f0; u00f0; u00f9; u00f0; u00f9; u00f1; u00f"

The cannoli is HUGE and absolutely full of the ricotta cream. I didn't love that the shell didn't seem super fresh but the filling was pretty good.

The person sending our order to the register was nice but forgot my son's sprinkle cookie, which did not make him happy. So check your bags before walking out the store. To be honest I had better chocolate chip cookies in my day. I figured since I have watched a few shows and knew of the person behind the bakery the food would be awesome, but it was just alright. We would have gotten a piece of cake, but my husband wasn't about to give them $8 for a slice. Good news, with your military ID you can get a discount.

https://www.yelp.com/biz/carlos-bakery-las-vegas-3,4,6/13/2021,"I was very excited to see Carlo's Bakery at the Venetian Shops. I had visited the original location in Hoboken and was blown away by the desserts and staff. This location was set up similarly in style. There was social distancing being enforced with only a few customers entering the bakery at one time. I walked over to the cases and browsed the goods. A staff member came up to me to take my order. I ordered two cupcakes (both with white cake - one chocolate icing and the other vanilla icing), two chocolate chip cookies, and two brownies. The staff member didn't speak much to me and didn't come off as very friendly. It could have been a busy day even if I arrived at a lull. After ordering, I was instructed to wait for my name to be called for pick up and to pay. I waited about 5 minutes before my name was called. Everything was packaged nicely so that it would survive the 5 minutes walk to my room at The Palazzo. My total was a little less than $30. Which seems a bit pricey for 6 items. When I got back to my room, I couldn't wait to dive right into a cupcake. It was delicious! The cake was moist and the icing was perfect! Just as I remembered from my visit to the Hoboken Bake Shop. After eating the cupcake, I couldn't help myself and I ate a chocolate chip cookie. It was so soft and chocolatey. These cookies were as good as the ones I brought home from The Hoboken Bake Shop for my family to try. Very tasty! The one thing I disliked was the brownie. It tasted off. I normally love fudge brownies, but I couldn't finish this one. It had that dusty chocolatey taste to it. The icing on top was okay. I was a bit disappointed with this dessert. Overall, I love this bakery! The cupcakes and cookies are by far my favorite from both this Vegas shop and the one in Hoboken. Definitely recommend!","https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Fy6C4X4nP4ZwGwb5ZTkq8g/348s.jpg, https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Ept1xuIQIvNPm4LkqibAng/348s.jpg","i have a friend who wants to try the sonic, so i've been trying to find a new place to eat my ice cream and now i'm writting about it - it's a bakery called california beignets, which is a huge bakery and food truck and was just recently at california beignets, the new owner is kinda cute and i would like to see the cupcakes that were here and the cake that looked like a big cake"

I ended up getting 2 lobster tails, 2 cannolis, and a strawberry cheesecake. The lobster tails were AMAZING. They were crispy and perfect, even when I ate it around 5 hours after buying them. I liked that they weren't too sweet and even my mom loved them. I am definitely going to buy more of those when I go back. The cannolis on the other hand weren't that good. I ended up only eating half of one and gave the other one away. I was disappointed in them and wish I had ordered more lobster tails instead. The cheesecake was expensive like almost $12 and it was so small. It was pretty good though, there's not much crust or anything like Cheesecake Factory ones but more like just the cheesecake part. If you're a cheesecake fan I definitely recommend. Overall I'd definitely go back for more lobster tails. I'd highly recommend you get some if you stop by!

https://www.yelp.com/biz/carlos-bakery-las-vegas-3,5,12/4/2021,"Would recommend getting the Hoboken Special as it contains most of the small pastries really signature to the Cake Boss show (cannoli, lobster tails, and the rainbow cake as slices). The lobster tail pastry is very similar to the Italian sfogliatella pastry, but is unique to New York and filled with French cream instead of ricotta cheese. Though I also REALLY loved the mini cheesecakes and was really happy about the variety of lobster tail flavors. Also, if you get a bigger order, double-check you got anything before leaving. Would recommend eating the lobster tails fresh. They're still good overnight in the fridge, but it's NOTHING compared to when you first get them. XD For those not as familiar, Carlo's Bakery is the Italian bakery featured on the Cake Boss show. They're based in Hoboken where the original bakery is, but now have locations all over the US and some in Canada. For those from California, they have a location in Santa Monica. This Las Vegas bakery location in The Venetian (so free parking) also faces their sister restaurant (Buddy V's Ristorante, different from Pizza Cake By Buddy Valastro that's down the Strip) and supplies the various Cake Boss ""ATMs"" (vending machines) where you can get fresh slices of the rainbow cake. XD If you're there when it's busy, you'll probably see employees with ordering pads taking orders as far down the line as they can. We kind of jumped the gun and ordered early on, but I would advise against doing so as there are more items up front near the register that you might want. Specifically, I wanted to get an additional lobster tail. They'll let you add it to your order but with how busy things get, things sometimes slip. In our case, since our whole order was in one taped-up box, we didn't realize we were charged for (but missing) the additional lobster tail. They were great about that though. We called ahead, they checked their records, and recognized us when we went back to get that pastry. And it was SO worth it. We ended up going back a couple of times while we were in Vegas, just kept coming back.

Looks cute and pretty for the kids but thats all there is to it. The cake was no different than what I would get at a supermarket or costco, so to speak but for 3x the cost!! Its as if i could have slapped a bunch of sprinkles on it myself and add a celebrity name to it and charge others triple! Bottom line: it was dense, WAY overly sweet and dry. Last thing we need is our kids any more hyper than they already are and many trips to the dentist which will add to that cost of this cake. Quite disappointed coming from a celebrity chef named behind it. Perhaps he needs to find another sous chef or another bakery to represent as this does not look good. On the defense, perhaps its just the cake and other treats they have are better but with this costly experience that was not even close to edible, it makes us hesitate to try other things. Let say for 2 small 6in cakes....we have half the cake of each leftover and the slice we each had on our plates were half eaten was how bad it was for our whole party. No one, not one person enjoyed it. Actually, even a 4 year old didn't even care for it saying it was not soft and moist enough which is bad. So I am surprised at the crazy long line other reviewers have stated as it is over rated and overly priced for what you get. Sorry but not sorry.

There was also a long line but it moved fairly quickly. I ordered all 4 lobster tail flavors because that seemed to be very popular amongst the yelp reviews.

I had a piece of each cannoli and I don't have much to compare it to so I thought it was really good. I prefer the original over the chocolate dipped one. The lobster tails were good. I wasn't expecting such a crunchy exterior but it definitely added texture to the soft cream inside. The red velvet was great. The cake was moist and the frosting had a nice flavor and consistency.

We had just finished lunch at Fukuburger and despite the fact that it was cold and windy, I was craving ice cream and in case you were wondering...no I'm not preggo :-) My friend recommended this spot and since I'm always about trying new places I readily agreed. I ordered the following: 1 pint of Chocolate Malt with Caramel (malted chocolate ice cream with caramel ripple) 1 pint of Coffee Chocolate Chip (coffee ice cream with chocolate chips) 1 scoop of Blue Monster (blue vanilla ice cream with Oreo Â® cookies and Nestle Â® Chocolate Chip Cookies) PROS: Ice cream was phenomenal. Creamy, silky smooth and delicious. Prices were very reasonable. CONS: Short line.....long wait. This wouldn't normally be a problem, but when it's super windy and you have to stand outside to order :-( I will definitely be back to try the other flavors.

Almond croissant: very good, buttery, flakey. I warmed it for 20 secs and devoured it.. that's why it's not pictured lol. This is what the 3 stars goes to... Pistachio Macaron: not a fan. It's very very sweet! Barely any pistachio flavor. At 4 something a pop, you'd hope it would be mindblowing. Nice feet, but air bubbles on top. Not nice and smooth.

I further explained maybe because I was wearing a mask and it was loud in the surrounding (inside a hotel and casino and there were many people), she may not heard it right. But I would like to exchange to the one I wanted. She gave me such a dirty look and was continuing accused me that's what I ordered.

The inside is closed, and we stood at the window for a few minutes and no one came - we almost walked away (sitting in AZ summer heat isn't my jam). However, the nicest woman was working the window when she came. They have a set menu but also some rotating specials. The people working explained the history of the business, owner, and flavors which was super nice. I chose a single scoop of the award winning Madagascar vanilla, the hubs went for the dough melt. The vanilla I had was very basic basic. Award worthy? No. I liked that it wasn't overly sweet, but I would give it maybe one step over your grocery store brands. The wafer cookie that it came with was probably the best part. The dough melt was just too much for me, a doughnut cut in half with ice cream I took a small piece and it didn't really taste like anything. If you live in AZ I'd say give it a shot.

Service isn't much different from the Chinatown location and there was practically no wait when my sister and I arrived around 3 pm. Their soft serve is on the creamier side. I find their flavors subtle and not overly sweet, which is typically how I prefer my desserts. I love that they keep flavors on rotation so I get to try something a little different every time I visit. The taiyaki is light and crisp on the outside. Not at all cakey as I've experienced with other places that also serve it. Serving size is also huge! I'm sure I've had to share one most of the time.

Let your inhibitions go. Coffee and donuts all in the same place. Happy is here until they lock the doors. Get here early to enjoy the best selections of the day before they are gone. It's always happy even if you have to wait in line. Explore there menu options on your phone. As the line dwindles down it's getting closer to your turn be ready! Oh you were not ready!

The Boston cream was average nothing special, it was nice and airy and the had a good cream ratio. The blueberry poptart donut was cool but again nothing special. The cinnamon roll was overbaked but the very center was good. The oreo cake donut was good as long as you got a bite full of oreo. The donut grilled cheese was massive and was pretty good I think. It came with a Sriracha dipping sauce. I forgot to snag a pic of it. The creme Bru Lee was very underwhelming it just tasted like a plain donut with filling. The Nutella donut was good but I didn't really taste the Nutella. I gave this place 2 stars because I was expecting so much more due to its rating but for the most part I was disappointed.

Apple fritters we're over cooked. Like you can see the dark color and hardness on the donut. Barely any glaze on it too. The cake batter was way bigger in size then others, which was weird to me because usually apple fritters are bigger then most. The Oreo was so tiny compared to the rest. Cake batter was pretty much just dipped icing donut with icing blobs on top. Sooo meh. Oreo cake batter, well just basically a stuffed donut with Oreos in middle with icing on top. Pop tart donut also overcooked with tiny icing on top. All very meh donuts and overly priced. If you want a good donut, go to pinks. Lease they are usually stocked and fresh and way better tasting.

I don't fault Mason's for this, but I would advise that you check their Instagram before making the trip to see the flavors beforehand since they rotate frequently. I ended up getting black sesame and chocolate butterfinger. It was good, but because very few flavors were super appealing to me, I felt I didn't get a true Mason's experience with my relatively safe and not-interesting combination. This was my first time having a Korean style corn dog and I thought that it was fun. My friend got a half cheese corn dog and I got a regular all beef corn dog and we really enjoyed them.

The portion size is good and not overwhelming. We ordered small size with waffle cone. There has always been a queue but it's a fast moving one. Great staff as well. There is enough place in front of the store to park and chill. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/FhXXuW6fHCQfKyN-VOP5yQ/o.jpg,a frozen dessert

There is plenty of parking in the lot under the tracks, alongside the building, and across the alley behind the business. And the ice cream, 10/10. We shared the banana split and were sure to order it with whipped cream and nuts. A very generous portion and the soft serve is some of the best. It's not just ice cream, but a wonderful experience - family, nostalgia, summer, all of the above. Take your family, take your date, take yourself - you won't regret it.",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/joPyHmyA19naR_Y-w1o89w/o.jpg,i can't believe this was free

I've had a lot of delicious ice cream experiences but this one was VERY high on my list. It's in a very interesting area - one that you need to get to by car and make sure some interesting liquids don't fall from the rain tracks above on to your car. This place is always busy so parking can be a little challenging, but we were able to find some next to the mechanic next door. The long line went by very quickly as they have a really well-oiled operation going on there! After we ordered, we also didn't need to wait very long for the ice cream. There were some areas for seating but it's mostly a place to grab and go - we ate our ice cream in the car. Well, what we could finish! The sundaes were INCREDIBLE but also MASSIVE - bigger than my face!! Next time, I think my husband and I will split a sundae (but there will definitely be a battle for the last bite!)

As for the ice cream, wow it's so good. I got the butterfinger, which is literally pre-mixed like a butterfinger McFlurry but in much better soft serve ice cream. My wife got the blueberry and wow it was literal actual blueberry ice cream. Great spot!",,
https://www.yelp.com/biz/pages-pittsburgh,5,7/18/2022,"We stopped by Page's for our last meal in Pittsburgh before starting the drive back to Baltimore, and I'm so glad we did. It's a traditional, old-fashioned, retro ice cream stand/burger spot. You'll probably come for the soft-serve, sundaes, or milkshakes, but don't skip the food. It's a to go or enjoy in your car place (no inside seating). We had a cheeseburger, hot dog, extra small vanilla sugar cone with chocolate dip, and another dip cone (can't remember what flavor my husband got)! They offer more than 25 soft serve flavors! They have everything from the traditional to the modern (vegan oat-based soft serve, cold brew milkshakes)! The cheeseburger was a classic - classic burger with American cheese, ketchup, mustard, onion, pickles, and mayo. The hot dog was classic too. And the soft serve really hit the spot on a hot day. This place is a classic. And I 100% enjoyed my meal and my soft serve, the service, and the retro vibes. I would absolutely come back. I might even get exactly the same thing. Is there anything better than a classic cheeseburger and chocolate-dipped soft serve sometimes!?

This place is super popular, we ended up waiting in line for maybe 15-20 minutes but the ice cream is worth the wait. I got the butterscotch sundae and the ice cream was so incredibly creamy. Probably one of the best soft serves I've ever had in my life.

We arrived and parked in their unassuming parking lot and got in (the very long) line. It was pushing 10pm and we were nervous about whether or not we'd be served before they closed. Amazingly, he incredible staff in PDM served every customer until the line was over. They were SO gracious and kind and they deserved every tip on the planet for being so awesome, in spite of the late night and the long long that remained at 10! By the time we reached the front of the line I decided to try the famous chocolate chip cookie sundae with pecans. When I say this was the best ice cream treat I've had in SUCH a long time, I mean it - an incredible warm cookie, delicious custard-y ice cream, hot fudge, and salty nuts? It was every bit as delicious as I hoped for, and again, the staff put their all into making great quality products despite the lateness of the evening. I'm so impressed and truly cannot wait to return. My husband (who enjoyed an enormous soft serve cone) said ""it's a good thing we don't live closer, otherwise we'd be there every day.""

I hadn't been back until a few weeks ago when I was bike riding on the trail nearby. Over the train tracks I spotted the Page's ice cream cone sign. I couldn't figure out how to get off the trail and over to the ice cream shop until I saw a man cross the railroad tracks eating an ice cream cone. Apparently other people had the same idea as I did. I left my boyfriend with the bikes and ran across the tracks and over to Page's. I got him a blueberry soft serve and I tried the toasted coconut. OMG the toasted coconut is unreal. It tastes like a toasted coconut donut. I am obsessed. When I posted photos, I got so many responses asking if I got the dairy free. I didn't even realize they had that! When we went yesterday, I ordered the dairy free (oat based) made into toasted coconut and dipped in chocolate (shoutout to Angie C. for the suggestion). My boyfriend tried the raspberry cheesecake arctic swirl and my brother tried the warm Nancy B's chocolate chip cookie sundae. Everything was great (and huge portions). The warm cookie sundae was enough for 2-3 people to share. The dairy free ice cream I got was perfect. This is absolutely my new ice cream order. We waited in line for about 20 minutes, and when we left the line was much longer. Side note- they do accept credit cards now.

We spent a long time reading all the history on the back of the building while enjoying the incredibly delicious ice cream!!! The staff was incredible! Let us take our time figuring out what we wanted and they were very understanding when the 5 year old changed his mind right as we paid! Thank you!

While at Ross Park Mall, I stopped by Sinful Sweets (or as their sign says, 'Cookies and Cream') and got some vanilla ice cream, a peanut butter deep dish cookie, and a chocolate macaron deep dish. There was only one lady working at the shop. She was extremely friendly. When it was time to pay, she tried to put the cookies into a cookie box but they ran out. Instead, she offered to put them in a different box and take the ice cream off of the price! That is extremely generous of her! The vanilla ice cream is delicious. Not too sweet, but has the exact flavor you want from a creamy vanilla ice cream. I only asked for a scoop, but it was 4 or 5! The cookie and macaron were both also delicious. For $3.50 each, it's definitely worth the price. These are thick, dense, and large cookies. The peanut butter has lots of Reeses on top of what seems to be a chocolate chip cookie. The edges are crispy and inside is pretty soft. The macaron was one of the best I've had. It was chocolate dipped, and also huge! Full of coconut. They also have chocolate, cupcakes, cookie dough, and milkshakes among other items. For a little shop in Ross Park Mall, this is beyond high quality! The young lady working there is awesome, too.

I'll explain.


We were in Madison on our summer road trip vacation. And it was hot. We were staying near the University, and Yelp led us to this ice cream spot. We needed it. So we walk in. Get multiple scoops of ice cream in a giant waffle cone. I'm not sure our daughter has ever had this much ice cream. But the prices can't be right. It's only this much for that giant ice cream cone? I didn't argue. But clearly they aren't gouging their customers.


It was delicious.


But here's where it gets dicey. As I'm outside, I now see the sign. ""With the exception of announced public events, use of the Wisconsin Union is restricted to UW-Madison students, Union members, faculty, staff and their guests.""


Uh oh. Did we just break into this place to get cheap, awesome ice cream? If yes, where's the Yelp attorney hotline number if I find myself in the clink?

I stopped in here for coffee with a friend one day, had never tried this spot but have heard good things (and really wanna check out The Literary as well!) I was just looking for a cup of warmth and maybe a couple of sweet treats.


We went in and it was so cute and intimate, a little bar near the window, some tables in the corner to work at, and a nice comfy couch with a gorgeous coffee table in the middle of the space. The walls were lined with various jams, cocktail mixes, teas, and coffees you could buy to try. A great little area to peruse while waiting for your coffee and food.


I ended up ordering the Salted Orange Mocha and my friend got a Plain Black Coffee, I paired my yummy mocha with a decadent ooey-gooey salted caramel brownie and a flakey buttery classic croissant. The brownie was so rich and the salted caramel balanced it out nicely so the chocolate wasn't too overpowering. The croissant was very buttery and had a nice crisp flakey outside. The inside was fluffy and had those beautiful croissant layers you look for. My mocha really shocked me, surprisingly I don't typically like chocolate and orange together but I do love trying new things. The orange in this is super soft and doesn't have quite the punch I thought it would, it dances over your tongue and gets enveloped by the mocha. It's a very subtle concoction and I would definitely order it again!


Overall this was a great coffee spot and it wasn't too crowded when we went in the afternoon. I think it may be a little overlooked with all the coffee shops on campus and downtown Champaign, I definitely think Hopscotch needs more recognition especially with all their cool coffee creations. I can't wait to go back and see what else they have to offer!

A sweet tooth craving?
Get a latte or soft serve
It's creamy and smooth.
---
Tasty matcha treats straight from the motherland. If you adore matcha, this shop is for you. There's soft serve, teas, latte floats, espressos, frappes, and affogatos.


I got the Instagrammable Maiko Special Parfait ($9.25): matcha and ube soft serve swirled together along with matcha chiffon, agar jelly, kuromitsu (black honey), chestnuts, matcha cake, shiratama mochi, cornflakes, and adzuki beans. The matcha and ube flavors were mild (I would have liked it stronger in taste), however, the soft serve was creamy, smooth, and not icy.

I can guarantee that this special experience will make you say ""I love matcha so matcha!"" after finishing your first dessert. I normally get their matcha soft serve, but you also can't go wrong with their other desserts and drinks on their menu.


DESSERT 1: Golden Shogun ($9.50) - This is the ultimate flex move. A soft-serve flavor of your choice (matcha, hojicha, seasonal) topped off with a 24k edible gold sheet in a waffle cone will make you feel like a millionaire. The matcha flavor is present, but it's definitely not one of the strongest I've tasted. I've made stronger matcha milkshakes at home.

YES, it's worth it for the experience and whenever you're in town (Overall 7/10)",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/y_X2lHgO4G4gxN2T9MuxWg/348s.jpg,"I've never eaten this dish before, but now I want it.

Location: In a blue building that says south end eats. You would definitely miss it if you aren't paying attention. This is a place you can sit down to eat . This is a take out spot only that houses multiple business.


Order: you have the option to order online or order inside at the kiosk. Highly recommend ordering online to avoid a long wait. It took about 20mins for me to get my order.


Parking: There is a small lot in front of the South End Eats building.

I absolutely adore this place and hope they will start extending their hours throughout the week (currently only open on the weekends)",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/mpwLsDdWZR5CYgc_8Kl1Kg/348s.jpg,This is the best place to find ice cream in the valley

I tried the Song of Fire and Ice, Knotty or Nice and Monster Cookie Dough. Loved all 3, but the Knotty or Nice was a favorite!


Winston and Potato enjoyed their time there as well!",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HvMCICYs0wu5Ki5XamxvKw/348s.jpg,"Great place for a quick lunch on the way to the airport, which is how I live in San Francisco!"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/churn-homemade-ice-cream-and-coffee-pittsburgh,5,3/12/2022,"We've been buying ice cream from Ice Cream Social (Katrina) for the last several months, and it's *easily the best ice cream in Madison.*


I'll say that again: THIS IS THE BEST ICE CREAM IN MADISON.


The flavors are creative, balanced, generously adorned with awesome mix-ins, and always delicious. The waffle cones are some of the best I've ever had (crunchy, maple-y, holds up well to the ice cream). And, the ice cream tastes even better knowing 10% (I think) of the proceeds go toward local charities working toward racial equity and other important causes.


Some of my faves:
--A Song of Fire and Ice
--Lavender Honeycomb
--Sage Against the Machine
--Knotty or Nice
--Salty Bee
--Roasted Banana
--Sweet Corn with Salted Butter Caramel
--The Bees Knees


Congratulations on opening your scoop shop, Katrina! Please put the proceeds from my future purchases into the ""Ice Cream Social--East Side Location"" fund!",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Eao81QaM1KbI1tKLwm-qjw/348s.jpg,"Great location, and the staff is friendly and informative."

So happy to support a female-owned business, especially with such delicious waffle cones. Very cute shop and the scooper gave me generous portions. The waffle cones pieces are fantastic, such a delicious caramel-y brown butter flavor. Definitely check this place out if you live in Madiso",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WtNOtn6662Aspgg6_SjLqA/348s.jpg,"I was pleasantly surprised by the variety of food choices and the very friendly staff.

Service: 5 Stars
Food: 5 Stars
Atmosphere: 4 Stars


This is a dessert counter. They have so many good choices. They have very small desserts, one to two bites, as well as regular size pieces of cake. As long as you enjoy the flavor profile here you should be happy with your selections.


The small desserts are $2.60. They have a mini lemon meringue that is two bites for me, but is perfect. I like to try a lot of different food while in Vegas, and this gives me to opportunity to do that. My mother is a very frugal woman and scoffed at these when she first saw them. Now it is her go-to dessert place. She likes that for under ten dollars she can enjoy three delicious flavors.


Their bigger desserts are also well made. They have a brown butter pear cake that is amazing. Their apple cake is also delicious. There is a Nutella-flavored dessert that is dense and flavorful. I have yet to see someone unhappy with their selection. If you have an MGM card you get a discount.


Definitely try this even if the line is long.


PS If you walk to the center of the whole Eataly complex there is a place to get a complimentary cup of water. It is self serve.",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/52UgV1v9bKhLgXhx-ta9GQ/348s.jpg,"I came here for lunch and was pleasantly surprised by the food and the atmosphere.

https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-pasticceria-las-vegas,5,4/5/2022,"YUMMY!
After having lunch at another spot in Eataly, I was craving something sweet, so we ventured over to La Pastcceria. As an Italian girl myself, I had to try a cannoli, as it's my most favorite dessert. Now be warned, my Mom makes the BEST cannolis, so I am always skeptical when I try one at a restaurant or Italian style bakery, but these cannolis are delicious! I would've had another one, but I was already stuffed from lunch...lol! My husband who is not a cannoli fan had mini cream puffs, and he said they were super yummy too!
La Pastcceria has several other sweet treats to try too, and they are all so pretty and look yummy!",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DGiMq9iRqBHxyQ2sPBGRdg/348s.jpg,"Great food, great service and a great atmosphere."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-pasticceria-las-vegas,5,5/22/2022,"Easily my favorite ice cream in Madison. I had enjoyed a mini waffle cone of the ""They See Me Rollin'"" flavor and it was too good! We also tried the orange pistachio chip (okay) and the ""it's brownies b*tch"" (really good). Definitely coming back for more.",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/3viph5JNg1uV7HeCibbR2A/348s.jpg,I love this place!

https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-pasticceria-las-vegas,5,2/18/2022,"We dropped by because of Lavazza, but we're intrigued by La Pasticceria's beautiful desserts instead.


When we were waiting in line/admiring the beautiful array of desserts, two Italian gentleman in front of us specifically requested the medium sized tiramisu, which could not be found in the case. When I ask them about it, they told me it's oh so good, it's dangerous. I don't know about you, but that kind of comment always makes me so curious that I gotta give it a try!


We ended up getting a passion fruit tart and the tiramisu, then we proceed to the seating area to dig into the goodness. We both loved the passionfruit tart. It was crunchy, sweet and refreshingly tarty. My boyfriend was very happy with it since he's a big passionfruit fan.


I was really impressed by the tiramisu, as the coffee, custard and dark cocoa powder played magic on my taste buds. I was never a tiramisu aficionado but now I finally get the hype. Those two were right, it was so tasty I couldn't stop eating it (danger to my waist line)!


Overall, I'm happy we came visit and got some awesome pastries. If you get a chance, definitely pay a visit, grab some coffee and try their medium size tiramisu. You won't regret it!",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qfSRXAw_33rqwaaLWJV_6A/348s.jpg,"I have been craving for some chinese food, and this place is just around the corner from me so i just decided to try it and i wasn't disappointed i could see the food and the interior design of the restaurant, and the decor is pretty cool too. I've had some pho in the past but the flavors were not strong enough for me to keep me coming back, so I went with this place and I will be eating there regularly now"

Great selection of good and desserts.
They are fairly quick even though they popping in the am with a line.
My bf ordered an


Hazelnut Iced Latte Cold Brew
Caramel Iced Latte Cold Brew
(light caramel)
(Both light ice)


Hazelnut was a bit sweeter so once we both drank a bit of each drink , we mixed our drinks and it was perfect amount of sweetness for us.


They have chairs and tables to eat up.
There's a wall full of extra goodies for ones travel snacks.


Enjoy snacking !!!!",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/k3VnzsufCU8-37wNZu32KA/348s.jpg,I went to the bar here at the hotel where my family and I are staying for the weekend and I had some breakfast and I thought I would try the coffee machine.

We were kind of full after having lunch but there's always room for us especially for eye-catching desserts. We ordered the Ciccio (cream puff with chan Tully cream $7.90), Baba Al Limoncello (pallini limoncello soaked sponge cake filled with lemon cream $7.90), and Terracotta (milk chocolate mousse filled with butter caramel $7.90) and a latte (forgot how much?). All the desserts tasted heavenly (5 stars to the pastries). The price was pricey and we spent around $36 total on 3 pastries and a cup of latte.

While we were checking out what they had we noticed they had labeled the allergens and even put on the little name card if something has gelatin. We liked this because then we were able to tell which options were vegetarian friendly and which ones were not. The girl pulling the order was very friendly and helpful. I'm not going to lie I did have low expectations because pastries in touristy areas can be pretty but tasteless, old, and dry but these surprised me and were very tasty. All of the pastries and the cookie we got were really good and seemed very fresh. I would definitely stop and grab desserts here again! I recommend giving them a try!",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/nRplWk_0c3XIEGFInPq-vA/348s.jpg,"I got the creme brulee, but it was way too sweet for me!
